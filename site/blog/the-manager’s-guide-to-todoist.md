Managing a team is like captaining a ship on open waters. It’s your job to steer the sails in the right direction, rally your crew on deck, and make the voyage a success.

While it can be incredibly rewarding, you’re bound to enter the choppy waters of stalled projects and missed milestones. You won’t encounter sharks, but you’ll inevitably come face-to-face with interpersonal issues and competing priorities along the way.

But challenges bring opportunities. Your team will look to you for direction, guidance, and support. You have the chance to build a positive work culture, create a high-output environment, and support your team in reaching their goals. Nevertheless, managers need their own support for staying on top of tasks, making time for strategic planning, and finding balance between work and life.
