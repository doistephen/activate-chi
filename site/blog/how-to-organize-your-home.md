We’ve spent a lot of time at home in 2020. Whether it’s the isolation seeping into our psyches or just too much time in the same place, you’re probably a bit tired of your space. From a make-shift office on the kitchen table to an impromptu classroom in the living room, your home has likely become a multi-purpose mess that’s spiralled out of control.

Given the circumstances, a bit of clutter makes sense. But overtime, the misplaced items and piles of junk take a toll on how we feel. A messy desk makes it hard to focus and a cluttered bedroom means it’s hard to unwind.
