title: Statement on the conviction of Derek Chauvin
socialSnippet: We hope the family has found some peace and finds refuge in this
  moment of justice. However, this does not fix the injustices of the past or

We hope the family has found some peace and finds refuge in this moment of justice. However, this does not fix the injustices of the past or ensure that justice will take place in the future. At the end of the day, George Floyd should be alive today. Adam Toledo should be alive today. Daunte Wright should be alive today. Breonna Taylor should be alive today. Countless others should still be alive today. We cannot rest until all systems of oppression are dismantled. We cannot rest until all BIPOC lives matter and are seen and treated as equal under the law. Make sure to still march today, tomorrow, and with us this Saturday \[04/24/21] as we call for police accountability and demand more funding and resources to go to community resources rather than the police.
