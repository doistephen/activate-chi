name: Policy Research Lead
---

The Policy Research Lead will work to influence political and social events, as well as raise public awareness on different issues. This involves conducting research, analyzing current policies, evaluating the effects of proposed legislation, and reporting on findings.

### How we work:

We do most of our work independently on our own time and check in weekly to discuss progress, collaborate, and ask questions in a 30-60 minute meeting. Because we are all volunteers with other jobs and responsibilities, we trust everyone to be accountable to their tasks and functions and to each other.

There is no hierarchy amongst the organizers, so we want you to feel empowered to form your role in whatever way you think is right for you and the organization. As such, the activities listed for this position are only a generic outline of the type of work we hope you'll contribute to Activate, with room for you to adjust and adapt as you see fit.

### How the Policy Research Lead will help us accomplish our goals:

- Ensure Activate is making informed advocacy by conducting policy research pertinent to our initiatives and sharing your findings with the group
- Make Activate:Chi a reputable source of local activist information by collaborating with the Social Media Manager to share research findings on our social media platforms

### Expected weekly commitment:

2-3 hours
