name: Director of Finance

The Director of Finance will be primarily responsible for planning, implementing, managing and running all the finance activities of Activate:Chi, including business planning, budgeting, forecasting and negotiations. Your responsibilities will also extend to obtaining and maintaining donor relations and partnership compliance.

### How we work:

We do most of our work independently on our own time and check in weekly to discuss progress, collaborate, and ask questions in a 30-60 minute meeting. Because we are all volunteers with other jobs and responsibilities, we trust everyone to be accountable to their tasks and functions and to each other.

There is no hierarchy amongst the organizers, so we want you to feel empowered to form your role in whatever way you think is right for you and the organization. As such, the activities listed for this position are only a generic outline of the type of work we hope you'll contribute to Activate, with room for you to adjust and adapt as you see fit.

### How the Director of Finance will help us accomplish our goals:

- Establish a sustainable revenue source of members from our community by creating and maintaining donor relationships
- Ensure Activate:Chi stays compliant and in good standing by overseeing audit and tax functions
- Help us plan realistic initiatives and actions by preparing and maintaining Activate:Chiâ€™s budgets

### Expected weekly commitment:

5-10 hours
