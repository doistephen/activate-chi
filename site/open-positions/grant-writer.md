The Grant Writer will research, draft, and submit proposals to help Activate:Chi receive grant funding.

### How we work:

We do most of our work independently on our own time and check in weekly to discuss progress, collaborate, and ask questions in a 30-60 minute meeting. Because we are all volunteers with other jobs and responsibilities, we trust everyone to be accountable to their tasks and functions and to each other.

There is no hierarchy amongst the organizers, so we want you to feel empowered to form your role in whatever way you think is right for you and the organization. As such, the activities listed for this position are only a generic outline of the type of work we hope you'll contribute to Activate, with room for you to adjust and adapt as you see fit.

### How the Grant Writer will help us accomplish our goals:

- Enable the organization to do more impactful work by securing grant funding from appropriate funding opportunities
- Keep Activate in good standing with our grantors by complying with all follow-up stipulations in grant awards.

### Expected weekly commitment:

2-3 hours
