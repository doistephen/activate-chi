name: Social Media Manager

The Social Media Manager is primarily responsible for planning, implementing, managing and monitoring Activate:Chi’s social media strategy in order to increase the public’s awareness of us and to help us use our platform more effectively.

### How we work:

We do most of our work independently on our own time and check in weekly to discuss progress, collaborate, and ask questions in a 30-60 minute meeting. Because we are all volunteers with other jobs and responsibilities, we trust everyone to be accountable to their tasks and functions and to each other.

There is no hierarchy amongst the organizers, so we want you to feel empowered to form your role in whatever way you think is right for you and the organization. As such, the activities listed for this position are only a generic outline of the type of work we hope you'll contribute to Activate, with room for you to adjust and adapt as you see fit.

### How the Social Media Manager will help us accomplish our goals:

- Use the Activate social platforms to make Activate:Chi a known and reputable source of local activist information online
- Ensure that all of Activate:Chi’s activities are shared online by taking the lead on content creation and posting on our social channels.
- Communicate your needs and visions with the Stephen, our Graphic Designer, so he can produce the branded assets needed for your work
- Maintain positive relationships with our community by replying and engaging with followers on our social platforms

### Expected weekly commitment:

3-5 hours
