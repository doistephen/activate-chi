  "ourStory": "Activate:Chi is a collective of multicultural and multigenerational community organizers initially brought together by our hunger for justice in the wake of the brutal police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and more.\n\nThe organizers of Activate met through social media outlets, at first just hoping to host one successful action, but after our success we decided to use our complementary skills and backgrounds to strive for greater change in the systems that continually marginalize many communities in Chicago and beyond. As a whole we believe in empowering others to make change within their own communities, preferring to provide the initiating energy, organization, and resources for grassroots organizers (or soon to be grassroots organizers) to be the change they wish to see in this world.\n\nâ€“ The Organizers of Activate:Chi"
