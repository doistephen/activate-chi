summary: >-
  “Who’s Next?” was Activate:Chi’s initiative to increase voter turnout in
  Chicago during the 2020 election. We organized 50 volunteers over three weeks
  and helped 300+ people with their voter registration. We created a website that informed 5,000 visitors of key policy issues on the Biden/Harris agenda and encouraged viewers to share their reasons for voting online. Other actions included murals, a commissioned song, and swag giveaways.
