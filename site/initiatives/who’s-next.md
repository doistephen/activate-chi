summary: “Who’s Next?” was Activate:Chi’s initiative to increase voter turnout
  in Chicago during the 2020 election. We organized 50 volunteers over three
  weeks and helped 300+ people with their voter registration. Our Who’s Next
  website (vote.activate-chi.org) informed 5,000 visitors of key policy issues
  on the Biden/Harris agenda and encouraged viewers to share their reasons for
  voting online.
