summary: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. With the police violence that has been occurring
  across the county, and specifically the murder of Daunte Wright and Adam
  Toledo most recently, it is time for us to again push for major reforms to the
  CPD. Last year there were incredible demonstrations across the country and we
  cannot let the momentum fade. Join us in making our collective voice heard
  across the city and nation that we will not stand idly by while vulnerable
  communities are terrorized and brutalized by racist and militarized police.
